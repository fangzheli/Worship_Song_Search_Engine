Resurrection Hymn (See What A Morning),"Verse 1 See, what the morning, gloriously bright, With the dawning of hope in Jerusalem; Folded the graveclothes, tomb filled with light, As the angels announce Christ is risen! See God’s salvation plan, wrought in love, Borne in pain, paid in sacrifice, Fulfilled in Christ, the Man, for He lives: Christ is risen from the dead! Verse 2 See Mary weeping, “Where is He laid?” As in sorrow she turns from the empty tomb; Hears a voice speaking, calling her name; It’s the Master, the Lord raised to life again! The voice that spans the years, speaking life, Stirring hope, bringing peace to us, Will sound ’til He appears, for He lives, Christ is risen from the dead! Verse 3 One with the Father, Ancient of Days, Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty, Honor and blessing, glory and praise To the King crowned with power and authority. And we are raised with Him, death is dead, Love was won, Christ has conquered. And we shall reign with Him, for He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!
